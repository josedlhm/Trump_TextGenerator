# Project for Python Class. 

We made two speech generators by finetuning openai's gpt model.

We trained one model on Trump's tweets and another on his campaign speeches from 2016.

Use the Generate_texts file to run the models. 

Trump_Speech_Generator_final shows how we trained the two models. 

Corpus_trump_speeches.json is the dataset containing the 2016 rally speeches. 

Trump_insults.json is the dataset containing the tweets.
